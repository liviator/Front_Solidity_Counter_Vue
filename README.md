# Vue Counter

This repository contains the front-end of a counter application using vuejs, typescript and ethereum. 

## Run the application

To run this application, clone this repo, type `cd Front_Solidity_Counter_Vue`and `yarn install`, you can then launch the application by typing `yarn dev` (will need to launch backend as well [here](https://github.com/liviator/backend_Count_solidity))

If you choose to replicate the application, you will need to redeploy the smart contract for example with remix(code [here](https://github.com/liviator/backend_Count_solidity/tree/master/smart_contract)) and change the abi in src/assets

The application is also deployed on Netlify [here](https://netlify--zingy-pithivier-4132a7.netlify.app/)
